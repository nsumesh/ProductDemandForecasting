# Product Demand Forecasting and Stockout Predictor

# Overview
This project forecasts daily product demand and highlights potential stockout risks for a multi-store retail chain using historical sales data and exogenous features such as promotions, holidays, and macroeconomic indicators.

The goal is to assist supply chain planners and category managers in making informed decisions on inventory replenishment, demand spikes, and stockout risks during the last two weeks of August 2017 (August 16â€“31).

# Dataset Description
The dataset is based on the [Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/favorita-grocery-sales-forecasting/data) Kaggle competition and includes:

- Historical daily sales per store_nbr, item_family, and date
- Store metadata: city, state, cluster, and store type
- Event calendar: holidays (local, regional, national), transferred holidays
- Oil price index as a proxy for economic activity
- Promotional flags
- Transactions (partial availability)
